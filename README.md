Twitter cont.

[contwinue.com](http://contwinue.com/)

If your Tweet is longer than 140 characters, contwinue will break it up into smaller tweets for you automatically.

## Setup

contwinue has been developed using the following:

* Ruby 2
* Rails 4
* MongoDB
* Unicorn

To get setup for development, execute:

```ruby
bundle install
```

To run the tests, execute one of the following:

* Run all the tests: `rake`
* Automatically watch the files changed and run the correct tests during development: `guard`

To run the server, execute:

```ruby
unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb
```

## Ideas

* User-configurable continuation text
* Better UI
  * Improved preferences page
* Ability to reply to a specific tweet. Update `tweetable`
  concern to add `in_reply_to_status_id` in `update` call.
* Utilize more methods in twitter-text gem like
  `Twitter::Validation.tweet_length` and
  `Twitter::Extractor.extract_urls_with_indices`.
